2.) What I learned

3.) Any road blocks or questions that I need to get answered

4.) What my goals are for tomorrow

**January 7th**
Today, I construct a datafrome from the movie dataset containing about 30000 movies. My plan is to use TFIDF vector and to predict the genre of movies. but when I run the program, everything stop, and I canâ€™t continue my project. I think I should start on the cloud to make it more stable. So I would like to start to build on cloud tomorrow.
 I also learned that there are many way to change word to vector. Here's the different:
 TFIDF Vector : It is the vector that get from the linear algebra calculation. This also show how most important for each word. 
 Word2Vec : It is the vector that get from neural network to illustrate how it relate to the other words. This might be used for finding some relationship between word, or information retrieving.
