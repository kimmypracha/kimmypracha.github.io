title: College Classification Project

This is the project that I've done by myself. It is about the college data. 
<h1> Looking at Data </h1>
 There are many factor to analyze here. The interesting factor is "for_profit". 
 I just knew that there are "for profit" in the US. The question is "Why some people goes to that kind of colleges?" If we look at the chi-square values below.

   The interesting things that I would like to discuss here are "avg_family_income", "faculty_salary","instructional_expenditure_per_fte", and "tuition_revenue_per_fte". 
    <h2> Average family income </h2>
       We would think economically here. If we think about the rich people, they can afford most of colleges that tend to be good for them. They are affordable to reach any resources, such as tutor, 
       so they tend to have a good college. In this scenario, they are a good indicator to good colleges here.
    <h2> Instructional expenditure per fte & Tuition revenue per fte</h2>
       In economy class, you might hear "You would get what you paid for". This sentence is true for 
       the fair trading. Sometimes, those college might not fair to you. Both factor can indicate well how much they get paid from student, how much they paid back to students. 
    <h2>Faculty salary</h2>
        If the faculty salary is high, that college would be worth to teacher to work here, but it's impossible that every teacher can work here. Therefore, the competition will qualify the best teacher who worth high salary, so the faculty salary is a good factor to indicate 
        briefly how good teacher in those colleges.
    <h2> Branches </h2>
        This factor seems to be supporter to other factor. In my opinion, if those colleges are "predatory", and they have many branches, they might "predate" too much, and that is not good at all. In contrast, if those colleges are not "predatory", and they have many branches, they might have a good famous and their reputation makes them have many branches.
    
    Additionally, all of these factors have the smallest p-value. That means they are the most statistically significant to the for_profit status, and I would include these factors as factors to rank the colleges.

<h1> Using Indicator to rank the score </h1>
        <p>At first, we use all important factor that we already described above to score each colleges. To give a definition in this scenario, we should focus on how each factor support "good environment"
        and give a "benefit" to student. It also make sense that the college that didn't give you any benefit. It would not be good at all. To measure the benefit, I use this equation: 
        $benefit = \text{Intructional_expenditure_per_fte} - \text{Tuition_revenue_per_fte}$
        if benefit is negative that means the tuition that they paid to college didn't equal to the instructional expenditure. Even if we didn't count knowledge, which is abstract, as a benefit in this formula, but we can still keep measures to rank how much they focus on instruction.
        <p> When we focus on just a college, we might consider the environment part and employee part. 
        In this part, I used this formula:
    <img src = "/images/classification_formula.png">
        <p>To be concise, we use branches as a magnitude of benefit that student get. If benefit is negative, that college seems predatory, otherwise, that college seems non-predatory. Branches can emphasized how strong predatory or non-predatory it is. If they are non-predatory and have many branches, that college might have very good reputation. In contrast, if they are predatory and have many branches, that college might be very predatory and it would not be good to student. 
        <p>In the other part, we used accreditation to figure out the sign of a mean of all benefit in each colleges, which is threshold value to combined with the benefit value for adjust the school_value because we might not count the knowledge part which can be compensated with the benefit, and the mean value of benefit is negative so we use this threshold to adjust this point, but we would consider on accreditation first. If that college is accredited, the score should increase, otherwise, the score should be decrease. Eventually, it comes up with formula above.
        <p> Lastly, in the school value part, we score every important factors by adding together. and we give some penalty to some school in two case:
            1. If that school is online-only, it might not encourage well on learning environment. so we will divide the score with some value
            2. If that school is under investigation, it would be risky, uncertain situation might not be good for colleges, which can disturb education, such as violences.
            All of this we use the number 0.5 if that is false, 1.5 if that is true. (If all of them are false, we would not decrease the score)
        <h1>Ranking<h1>
            According to formula above, we don't want to deal with very huge number. So we use "StandardScaler" on the "benefit_of_student" with we have to raise with "school_value". which is would be on the same rank, but we just want number to be small.
            After we got the worthy_of_school value to rank, it is also have a wide rank value to plot histogram. So we take logarithm function on it. and rank it. Finally, we got this.
